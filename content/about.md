Use Arius to publish data and buy data. Earn by selling your data. Data is published as interoperable ERC721 data NFTs and ERC20 data tokens. 

Compute-to-Data allows private data to be bought and sold. It is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that is aligned with data.

Our marketplace uses Ocean Protocol, which enables the best and most secure infrastructure for exchanging data.


## Data Publishers Monetize your data, while preserving privacy and control.

The rise of data-driven AI has had a very positive impact on corporate profits. But what about solving societal problems? 

What can data-driven AI do for health? How about using data to develop better models for cancer, Parkinson's and so on? 

A friend of mine is a life science researcher with two decades of experience. He is currently doing research on proteins and gene therapies. He told me that he is happy if he gets 100 data points or does not make the same mistakes as others. There are thousands of input variables. With so many input variables and so few data points, his AI models are pretty terrible. But he can't get more data because he's afraid of lack of privacy and incentives. We want this data, and it exists. But how do we get all this data in a way that benefits humanity without compromising privacy or control?


## Data Consumers


Buy data that you couldn’t get before: private data.

Compute-to-data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it to get useful compute results like averaging or building an AI model.

The most valuable data is private data — using it can improve research and business outcomes. But concerns over privacy and control make it hard to access. With Compute-to-Data, private data isn’t directly shared but rather specific access to it is granted.

It can be used for data sharing in science or technology contexts, or in marketplaces for selling private data while preserving privacy, as an opportunity for companies to monetize their data assets.

Private data can help research, leading to life-altering innovations in science and technology. For example, more data improves the predictive accuracy of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Private data is often considered the most valuable data because it’s so hard to get at, and using it can lead to potentially big payoffs.
