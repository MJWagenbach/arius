Compute-to-data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it to get useful compute results like averaging or building an AI model.


### Control

Data owners retain control of their data, since the data never leaves the premises.


### Huge datasets

Data owners can share or sell data without having to move the data, which is ideal for very large datasets that are slow or expensive to move.

### Compliance

European data protection regulations (GDPR) require sensitive data to stay on European soil. C2D makes that easy, since data stays on-prem.
